Compile.js
=========

### Summary

Compile.js is a GruntJS inspired JavaScript build tool for the browser.
Compile.js makes it easy to create front end custom build widgets for your open-source projects.

### Features

* Fluent API
* HTTP GET Files Cross-domain
  * XHR for same origin
  * Compile.js JSONP proxy server for cross origin
* Trigger File Downloads
  * Chromes a.download for instant
  * Compile.js server POST replay for download for other browsers
* Provided tasks
* Auto-parallelisation

### Download

Use the [Compile.js API Explorer](http://jpillora.com/compilejs/builder/index.html) to compile your own build of Compile.js (very meta)

### Usage

Minify your library with [UglifyJS2](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

``` javascript
$.compile
  .fetch('lib', 'js/my-lib.js')
  .run('uglify', {
    src: 'lib',
    dest: 'lib-min'
  })
  .download('lib-min');
```

### Demos

* [Download example](http://jpillora.com/compilejs/example/download.html)
* [CoffeeScript example](http://jpillora.com/compilejs/example/coffee.html)
* [Concatenate example](http://jpillora.com/compilejs/example/concat.html)
* [Popup example](http://jpillora.com/compilejs/example/popup.html)

### API

*Note: You can play with this API using the [Compile.js API Explorer](http://jpillora.com/compilejs/builder/index.html)*

#### `$.compile`.`get( name[s], callback( err, value[s] ) )`

Get a value

* `name[s]` - string or an array of strings

* `value[s]` - same type as `name[s]`

#### `$.compile`.`set( name, value )`

Set a value.

* `name` - string
* `value` - string

#### `$.compile`.`fetch( name, url )`

Fetches a URL and 

* `name` - string
* `url` - string

*Note: `url` will be retrieved with an XHR request if it has the same origin as the current page, otherwise it will be retrieved using the Compile.js JSONP proxy server*

#### `$.compile`.`run( taskName, taskConfig )`

Runs the given task with the given config

* `taskName` - string
* `taskConfig` - object

#### `$.compile`.`download( name )`

Downloads the value of `name` as `filename`

* `name` - string
* `filename` - string [optional] - defaults to "`name`.js"

*Note: On browsers that do not support [anchor download attribute](http://caniuse.com/download), the download
will be forced by POSTing the contents of the file to the Compile.js POST replay server which
will just return the content though with the `Content-Disposition` header set.*

#### `$.compile`.`popup( name )`

Open a small popup with the value of `name`

* `name` - string

*Warning: This will likely trigger a popup warning from most modern browsers*

#### `$.compile`.`log( callback ( string ) )`
#### `$.compile`.`error( callback ( string ) )`
#### `$.compile`.`warn( callback ( string ) )`

Log, Error and Warning handlers

### Tasks

#### `$.compile`.`task( taskName, definition )`

Adds a new task

If `definition` is:

* a string, it will be treated as a script URL and attempt to load it.
* a function, it must have the signature `function(config, callback)`
  * `config` will contain the object the user provides
      * `config.src` *Note: the `src` property will be passed through `instance`.`get()` and
         when this function is executed, `config.src` will be the the `value[s]`
         associated with the `name[s]`*
  * `callback` must be called when the task is complete

* If `definition` is a object, it must contain a:
  * `run` function - which matches the signature above

  and optional:

  * `fetch` object - which map global names to URLs, missing globals will be fetched. *Useful for lazy loading dependancies.*
  * `init` function - which will run once all URLs have been fetched.

#### [Task list](https://github.com/jpillora/compilejs/tree/gh-pages/dist/tasks)

* Concat - [Built-in](https://github.com/jpillora/compilejs/blob/gh-pages/src/compile.coffee#L236)
* CoffeeScript - [compile.coffee-script.js](https://github.com/jpillora/compilejs/tree/gh-pages/dist/tasks/compile.coffee-script.js)
* Uglify - [compile.uglify.js](https://github.com/jpillora/compilejs/tree/gh-pages/dist/tasks/compile.coffee-script.js)
* *More to come...*

Using the [Compile.js API Explorer](http://jpillora.com/compilejs/builder/index.html), you can build a custom version of Compile.js which includes a subset of these tasks.

#### Conceptual Overview

This library uses method chaining. There is no "create" method because a static verions of each chainable method is made which adds an extra step - creates an instance - then the corresponding instance method is called (Code is [here](https://github.com/jpillora/compilejs/blob/gh-pages/src/compile.coffee#L242)). Each instance has an event emitter. When you `get()`, an event listener will watch for the `name` to be set. When you `set()`, an event will be fired - triggering all listeners. This way, the order of operations will work itself out.
